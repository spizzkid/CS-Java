Write a method called vowelCount that accepts a String as a parameter and produces/returns an array of integers representing the count of each vowel in the String.   
The array returned by your method should hold five elements: the first is the count of the 'A's,
the second is the count of 'E's, the third 'I''s, the fourth 'O's and the fifth the number of 'U's.  Your count should check for both upper and lower case versions.

For example the call vowelCount("I think therefore I am") should return the array [1,3,3,1,0].

Your main program should then allow the user to type in single lines, analyzing each line and print out its count.
The program should stop when the user types the word "STOP" by itself.
