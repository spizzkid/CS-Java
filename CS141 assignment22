Very similar to the prior assignment, for this assignment I want you to write a Fraction class that works with the FractionMath program above.   You can download the above file, and then it should use your Fraction.java file to run.

Remember that fractions cannot have zero in the denominator, so if you ever have to change the denominator to zero, make it one instead.

Your Fraction class should have the following

Fields
a numerator  (int)
a denominator (int)
Methods
A default constructor
that sets the numerator  to 1
that sets the denominator to 1
A full constructor
That accepts both the numerator and denominator.
Note that if the denominator is zero, you should change it to a 1.
A toString() method
That returns a string in the format
 {space} numerator / denominator {space}
 2/5 
however,  if the denominator is 1, then the fraction is a whole number so you should just return the numerator.
i.e.  do not print 4/1  just print 4.
getNumerator()
getDenominator()
These should just return the values with no changes.
setNumerator()
This should change the numerator
.setDenominator()
This should change the denominator, as long as it isn't zero.  
If it is zero, then don't change anything, make no changes.
getDecimalValue()
This should return the decimal value of the fraction
3/4 would return 0.75
equals (Fraction other)
This method should return a boolean type. 
This method should compare the decimal value of this fraction with the decimal value of the "other" point and see if they are equal or not. 
If equal return true, else return false;
multiply(Fraction other)
This method should take the current fraction and multiple it by the "other" fraction and change the value to the new fraction.
So if x = 2/5 and y  = 3/4
then x.multiply(y)
would change x to 6/20
but leave y as 3/4
