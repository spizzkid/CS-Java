// Java 141 assignment16
Write a program that asks the user 4 questions:

How many random numbers do they want?
What is the smallest random number?
What is the largest random number?
What filename do they want to use?
 

Your program should then create the necessary random numbers, and write them to the file indicated.  

However your program should print 5 numbers per line.   So for example if the use asks for 44 numbers, there should be 8 rows of 5 and 1 row of 4 numbers.  The numbers should be separated by comma's.  However you need to make sure that the last element does not have a comma behind it.

So if the answers to the four quetions are above were the following:

24
10
20
The File.txt.

Example:
Then in  "The File.txt" I might see

12,13,14,17,20,
14,12,11,13,13,
11,11,17,18,14,
12,16,17,19,19,
12,12,15,15
