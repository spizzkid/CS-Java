Main program File : BankAccountMainProgram.java

For this assignment I want you to write a BankAccount class that works with the BankAccountMainProgram above.   You can download the above file, and then it should use your BankAccount.java file to run.

Your BankAccount class should have the following

Fields
a Private ID  (int)
a private Name (String)
a private balance (double)
Methods
A default constructor
that sets the ID to 0
the balance to 0
the name to "unknown"
A full constructor
That accepts all three values and sets the values accordingly.
A toString() method
That returns a string in the format
Name [ID] = $balance
Example: Betty  [1233203]  = $105.51
getName()
getBalance()
getID()
These should just return the values with no changes.
setName()
This should change the name on the account, and only the name.
changeBalance(double x)
This should add the amount x to the balance.
if x is negative you still add it, but the balance should go down.
If the balance is negative, then set it to zero before finishing.
Upload the BankAcount.java file when you are done.

The solution for this assignment is called BankAccount.java.
